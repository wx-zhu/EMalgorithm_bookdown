# EM Algorithm - Bookdown

## About The Project
Hello everyone! Welcome to the Github repository for our Math/Stat 455 Spring 2023 capstone project on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Our team consists of Wenxuan Zhu, Jingyi Guan, and Sarah Tannert-Lerner.

Our project bookdown showcases the EM algorithm and its applications in image segmentation, as well as its usage in various statistical models such as the Binomial mixture model, Gaussian mixture model, and Hidden Markov model. We aim to provide a clear and concise explanation of the EM algorithm and how it can be used in different contexts.
